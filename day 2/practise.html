    <P>
        East India is comprised of the states of West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura, and Orissa. This region is home to beaches and mountains and Cherrapunji, the city with the highest rainfall in the world.
        Because of the climate, Eastern India grows a lot of rice! Green vegetables and fruit are also abundant and thus are the recipes using them. People, though, are a balanced mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The geographical location of this region means its food bears the strong influence of Chinese and Mongolian cuisine.

    <p>North Indian food is characterized by its rich flavors, diverse dishes, and the use of wheat, dairy, and spices. While wheat-based foods like roti, naan, and paratha are staple in the region, dairy products such as yogurt, ghee, and paneer play a central role in many dishes. North Indian cuisine is known for its use of spices like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and cardamom, which give the food its distinct flavors. Popular dishes include creamy curries like butter chicken, dal makhani, and paneer butter masala, as well as aromatic rice dishes like biryani and pulao. The regionâ€™s street food, including chaat, golgappa, and samosas, offers tangy and spicy snacks. Each area has its own specialties: Punjab is known for hearty meals like sarson da saag with makki di roti and tandoori dishes, while Rajasthan offers bold, spicy foods like laal maas. Cooking methods like slow cooking and the use of the tandoor (clay oven) further enhance the depth of flavors. Meals typically include a main dish, rice or roti, accompaniments like raita or pickles, and often a sweet treat like gulab jamun or kheer, making North Indian cuisine a rich and satisfying experience.</p>
